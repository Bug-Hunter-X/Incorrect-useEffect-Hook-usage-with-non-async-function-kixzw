This repo demonstrates a common mistake in React's `useEffect` hook: using a non-async function for data fetching or asynchronous operations that expect a state update within the callback. The `bug.js` file showcases the incorrect implementation which leads to the count value not being updated as expected. The `bugSolution.js` file shows the correct implementation using `async/await` within the `useEffect` hook or promises for properly handling asynchronous operations.
